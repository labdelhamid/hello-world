    <h3>Introduction: Hi! My name is Lama Abdelhamid, and I am a freshman English & Secondary Education Major and Spanish minor at Lewis University.
        I am part of a family of 8, including my mom, dad, older brother & four younger sisters.</h3>
    What I Hope to Learn in this Course:
     <ul> 
            <li>The basics of coding</li>
            <li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
            <li>Networks</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>My Favorite / Activity:
        <br>My favorite hobby or activity is to read, which probably makes sense considering I'm an English major.
            I particularly like to read YA fantasty, contemporary, realistic fiction & graphic novels. I've loved to read ever since 
        I was a little kid.
    </h4>
<h5> Fun Fact:
    <br>A fun fact about me is that I am bilingual and speak English and Arabic fluently. It's also mentioned that I'm a 
        Spanish minor but I don't consider myself to be fluent in that language.
     </h5>
Greatest Innovations:
<ul>
    <li>The development of the internet <a href="https://www.scienceandmediamuseum.org.uk/objects-and-stories/short-history-internet"></a></li>
    <li>Inventing the first computer <a href="https://science.howstuffworks.com/innovation/inventions/who-invented-the-computer.htm"></a></li>
    <li>Creating email as a communicating source <a href="https://www.inventorofemail.com/"></a></li>
</ul>
